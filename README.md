# Verify Tweet

Fake tweet images can be generated using a preset meme template from websites like: [TweetGen](https://www.tweetgen.com/), [Prank Me Not](http://www.prankmenot.com/?twitter_tweet) and [Simitator](http://simitator.com/generator/twitter/tweet) . Verification of such tweets takes a manual work to find the user, scroll through their timeline and matching. A viral fake tweet image can prove crucial at a time.

A fake tweet screenshot looks very convincing, misleading the general public. For example:

|Tweet 1             |  Tweet 2 |
|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|

Verify Tweet attempts to resolve the problem by letting users upload such tweet screenshots and verify if the user actually tweeted or not. A combination of Image processing, Natural language processing as well as Twitter Search API makes this possible. Due to Twitter API rate limits, currently only tweets from last 7 days can be verified.
